# [RHB Jom Hack](https://www.jomhack.com/rhbhackathon/)

## The Challenge

> How might we enable the **creation and validation of financial information**, **robust future cash flow predictions** and **sustainable business model strategies** for **fast growing startups or companies** so that we can help **build trusted and transparent credit profiles** that provide RHB greater level of confidence of their credit-worthiness?

## Running the App

First, activate the virtual environment.

```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

You should see a green "`(env)`" appears in your terminal, indicating that you're now inside the virtual environment. Anything you do and install for the app will be contained inside this environment.

Running the app on localhost.

```
python run.py
```

To quit or exit the virtual environment, type

```
deactivate
```

## Packages

A list of packages current available in the virtual environment (Help keep track!).

```
flask
flask_sqlalchemy
flask_wtf
flask_bcrypt
flask_login
wtforms

To install a new package, make sure you are in the virtual environment.
